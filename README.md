# braph.sh
A shell script to draw graphs in terminal using unicode braille characters

# Usage
Set ``declare_y()`` to your liking, then run.  
``export -f declare_y``  
``./braph.sh``  
you can also optionally specify a number from 0 to 7 for the color of your line.  
as it does not clear the screen itself it can be used to draw multiple functions overlaid.
